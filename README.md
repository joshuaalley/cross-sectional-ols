# cross-sectional-ols
Replication of published work is a common part of introductory social science methods courses. In classes on OLS, work with cross-sectional data is easiest to replicate, but these papers are also hard to find. 

This repository contains replication materials for some papers with cross-sectional data and an OLS estimator. Each folder contains the paper and replication data, and some also have code. 

To use the repository, you can download or clone the whole thing, or download individual files for a particular paper. 

Feel free to add data or papers by forking the repository and making changes. Alternatively, you can also email me. 

For a longer introduction, see [this introductory blog post at *The Political Methodologist*](https://polmeth.org/blog/open-collection-political-science-research-ols-models-and-cross-sectional-data).
